/* logs ========================================================================
 * This function is used to send error messages to the client browesr and
 * to the log file. It is also used to write all the activities of the server
 * to the same log file. The default log file is named "web-server.log" and
 * located in the root directory of the web site.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *  type - Message type, one of: ERROR,FORBIDDEN,NOTFOUND,SERVERROR,MSG1..MSG8.
 *  req -- Request ID about which the message is produced (an integer).
 *  s1 --- The error/log message (a string).
 *  s2 --- Additional information about the cause of the message (a string).
 *  num -- Additional number to ID entity related to the message (an integer).
 *
 * Depending on the message type, the following actions are performed:
 *  ERROR: "ERROR:", s1, s2, error# & proc.ID logged.
 *  FORBIDDEN: causes two actions:
 *      1. A "Forbidden" web page containing s1 and s2 is sent to req (clnt-fd).
 *      2. "FORBIDEN:", req, num, s1 and s2 are logged.
 *  NOTFOUND:  causes two actions:
 *      1. A "Not Found" web page containing s1 and s2 is sent to req (clnt-fd).
 *      2. "NOTFOUND:", req, num, s1 and s2 are logged.
 *  SERVERROR: causes four actions:
 *      1. Request (req - to be dropped) is read from the client.
 *      2. A "Server Error" web page containing s1 and s2 sent to req (clnt-fd).
 *      3. "SRVERROR:", num, s1, s2 and req are logged.
 *      4. The connection with the client at req is closed.
 * Types MSG1 to MSG8 give wide choices for where to place message parameters:
 *  MSG1:  "LOG:", s1 and s2 only are logged.
 *  MSG2:  "LOG:", s1, s2 and num only are logged.
 *  MSG3:  "LOG:", s1, num and s2 only are logged
 *  MSG4:  "LOG:", num, s1 and s2 only are logged
 *  MSG5:  "LOG:", req, num, s1 and s2 are logged.
 *  MSG6:  "LOG:", s1, req, s2 and num are logged.
 *  MSG7:  "LOG:", req, s1, num and s2 are logged.
 *  MSG8:  "LOG:", req, s1, s2 and num are logged.
 *
 * When logging is done or errors are encountered, function returns normally.

/* serve =====================================================================
 * This function does all the work needed to get and serve an HTTP request:
 *    1. Read the HTTP input string from the given client's file descriptor.
 *    2. Parse through the input string (the request from the browser).
 *    3. Check for errors in the request.
 *    4. Extract the path, file name and extension.
 *    5. Send a response header to the browser.
 *    6. Send the requested file.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *  sfd -- The file descriptor for the client process (the browser).
 *  hit -- The hit counter. Used as identifier for logging only.
 *
 * When errors are encountered, this function logs a FORBIDDEN or a NOTFOUND
 * message and returns.  When work is done, this function returns normally.
 * ===========================================================================
